And  a  certain  man  from  Bethlehem  in  Judah,  with  his  wife  and  two  sons,  went  to  reside  in  the  land  of  Moab.  
  <b> 2  </b></a></span>  The  man&#8217;s  name  was  Elimelech,  his  wife&#8217;s  name  was  Naomi,  and  the  names  of  his  two  sons  were  Mahlon  and  Chilion.  They  were  Ephrathites  from  Bethlehem  in  Judah,  and  they  entered  the  land  of  Moab  and  settled  there.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 3  </b></a></span>  Then  Naomi&#8217;s  husband  Elimelech  died,  and  she  was  left  with  her  two  sons,  
  <b> 4  </b></a></span>  who  took  Moabite  women  as  their  wives,  one  named  Orpah  and  the  other  named  Ruth.  <p  class=|reg|>  And  after  they  had  lived  in  Moab  about  ten  years,  
  <b> 5  </b></a></span>  both  Mahlon  and  Chilion  also  died,  and  Naomi  was  left  without  her  two  sons  and  without  her  husband.  
  <p  class=|hdg|>Ruth&#8217;s  Loyalty  to  Naomi<p  class=|reg|>  <b> 6  </b></a></span>  When  Naomi  heard  in  Moab  that  the  LORD  had  attended  to  His  people  by  providing  them  with  food,  she  and  her  daughters-in-law  prepared  to  leave  the  land  of  Moab.  
  <b> 7  </b></a></span>  Accompanied  by  her  two  daughters-in-law,  she  left  the  place  where  she  had  been  living  and  set  out  on  the  road  leading  back  to  the  land  of  Judah.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 8  </b></a></span>  Then  Naomi  said  to  her  two  daughters-in-law,  &#8220;Go  back,  each  of  you  to  your  mother&#8217;s  home.  May  the  LORD  show  you  loving  devotion,<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>a</a></span>    as  you  have  shown  to  your  dead  and  to  me.  
  <b> 9  </b></a></span>  May  the  LORD  enable  each  of  you  to  find  rest  in  the  home  of  your  new  husband.&#8221;  <p  class=|reg|>  And  she  kissed  them  as  they  wept  aloud  
  <b> 10  </b></a></span>  and  said,  &#8220;Surely  we  will  return  with  you  to  your  people.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 11  </b></a></span>  But  Naomi  replied,  &#8220;Return  home,  my  daughters.  Why  would  you  go  with  me?  Are  there  still  sons  in  my  womb  to  become  your  husbands?  
  <b> 12  </b></a></span>  Return  home,  my  daughters.  Go  on,  for  I  am  too  old  to  have  another  husband.  Even  if  I  thought  there  was  hope  for  me  to  have  a  husband  tonight  and  to  bear  sons,  
  <b> 13  </b></a></span>  would  you  wait  for  them  to  grow  up?  Would  you  refrain  from  having  husbands?  No,  my  daughters,  it  is  much  more  bitter  for  me  than  for  you,  because  the  hand  of  the  LORD  has  gone  out  against  me.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 14  </b></a></span>  Again  they  wept  aloud,  and  Orpah  kissed  her  mother-in-law  goodbye,  but  Ruth  clung  to  her.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 15  </b></a></span>  &#8220;Look,&#8221;  said  Naomi,  &#8220;your  sister-in-law  has  gone  back  to  her  people  and  her  gods;  follow  her  back  home.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 16  </b></a></span>  But  Ruth  replied:  <p  class=|indent1stline|>&#8220;Do  not  urge  me  to  leave  you  <p  class=|indent2|>  or  to  turn  from  following  you.  <p  class=|indent1|>  For  wherever  you  go,  I  will  go,  <p  class=|indent2|>  and  wherever  you  live,  I  will  live;  <p  class=|indent1|>  your  people  will  be  my  people,  <p  class=|indent2|>  and  your  God  will  be  my  God.  
  <p  class=|indent1|>  <b> 17  </b></a></span>  Where  you  die,  I  will  die,  <p  class=|indent2|>  and  there  I  will  be  buried.  <p  class=|indent1|>  May  the  LORD  punish  me,  <p  class=|indent2|>  and  ever  so  severely,  <p  class=|indent1|>  if  anything  but  death  <p  class=|indent2|>  separates  you  and  me.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 18  </b></a></span>  When  Naomi  saw  that  Ruth  was  determined  to  go  with  her,  she  stopped  trying  to  persuade  her.  
  <p  class=|hdg|>The  Return  to  Bethlehem<p  class=|reg|>  <b> 19  </b></a></span>  So  Naomi  and  Ruth  traveled  until  they  came  to  Bethlehem.  When  they  entered  Bethlehem,  the  whole  town  was  stirred  because  of  them,  and  the  women  of  the  town  exclaimed,  &#8220;Can  this  be  Naomi?&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 20  </b></a></span>  &#8220;Do  not  call  me  Naomi,<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>b</a></span>&#8221;  she  replied.  &#8220;Call  me  Mara,<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>c</a></span>    because  the  Almighty<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>d</a></span>    has  dealt  quite  bitterly  with  me.  
  <b> 21  </b></a></span>  I  went  away  full,  but  the  LORD  has  brought  me  back  empty.  Why  call  me  Naomi?  After  all,  the  LORD  has  testified  against  me,  and  the  Almighty  has  afflicted  me.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 22  </b></a></span>  So  Naomi  returned  from  the  land  of  Moab  with  her  daughter-in-law  Ruth  the  Moabitess.  And  they  arrived  in  Bethlehem  at  the  beginning  of  the  barley  harvest.   <span  class=|fnverse|>8</span>  <span  class=|footnotesbot|>a</span>  Forms  of  the  Hebrew  <i>chesed</i>  are  translated  here  and  in  most  cases  throughout  the  Scriptures  as  <i>loving  devotion</i>;  the  range  of  meaning  includes  <i>love</i>,  <i>goodness</i>,  <i>kindness</i>,  <i>faithfulness</i>,  and  <i>mercy</i>,  as  well  as  <i>loyalty  to  a  covenant</i>.<br><span  class=|fnverse|>20</span>  <span  class=|footnotesbot|>b</span>  <i>Naomi</i>  means  <i>pleasant</i>.<br><span  class=|fnverse|>20</span>  <span  class=|footnotesbot|>c</span>  <i>Mara</i>  means  <i>bitter</i>.<br><span  class=|fnverse|>20</span>  <span  class=|footnotesbot|>d</span>  Hebrew  <i>Shaddai</i>;  also  in  verse  21<br> 
 Ruth  2   <p  class=|hdg|>Boaz  Meets  Ruth<p  class=|reg|>  <b> 1  </b></a></span>  Now  Naomi  had  a  relative  on  her  husband&#8217;s  side,  a  prominent  man  of  noble  character  from  the  clan  of  Elimelech,  whose  name  was  Boaz.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 2  </b></a></span>  And  Ruth  the  Moabitess  said  to  Naomi,  &#8220;Please  let  me  go  into  the  fields  and  glean  heads  of  grain  after  someone  in  whose  sight  I  may  find  favor.&#8221;  <p  class=|reg|>&#8220;Go  ahead,  my  daughter,&#8221;  Naomi  replied.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 3  </b></a></span>  So  Ruth  departed  and  went  out  into  the  field  and  gleaned  after  the  harvesters.  And  she  happened  to  come  to  the  part  of  the  field  belonging  to  Boaz,  who  was  from  the  clan  of  Elimelech.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 4  </b></a></span>  Just  then  Boaz  arrived  from  Bethlehem  and  said  to  the  harvesters,  &#8220;The  LORD  be  with  you.&#8221;  <p  class=|reg|>&#8220;The  LORD  bless  you,&#8221;  they  replied.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 5  </b></a></span>  And  Boaz  asked  the  foreman  of  his  harvesters,  &#8220;Whose  young  woman  is  this?&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 6  </b></a></span>  The  foreman  answered,  &#8220;She  is  the  Moabitess  who  returned  with  Naomi  from  the  land  of  Moab.  
  <b> 7  </b></a></span>  She  has  said,  &#8216;Please  let  me  glean  and  gather  among  the  sheaves  after  the  harvesters.&#8217;  So  she  came  out  and  has  continued  from  morning  until  now,  except  that  she  rested  a  short  time  in  the  shelter.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 8  </b></a></span>  Then  Boaz  said  to  Ruth,  &#8220;Listen,  my  daughter.  Do  not  go  and  glean  in  another  field,  and  do  not  go  away  from  this  place,  but  stay  here  close  to  my  servant  girls.  
  <b> 9  </b></a></span>  Let  your  eyes  be  on  the  field  they  are  harvesting,  and  follow  along  after  these  girls.  Indeed,  I  have  ordered  the  young  men  not  to  touch  you.  And  when  you  are  thirsty,  go  and  drink  from  the  jars  the  young  men  have  filled.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 10  </b></a></span>  At  this,  she  fell  on  her  face,  bowing  low  to  the  ground,  and  said  to  him,  &#8220;Why  have  I  found  such  favor  in  your  eyes  that  you  should  take  notice  of  me,  even  though  I  am  a  foreigner?&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 11  </b></a></span>  Boaz  replied,  &#8220;I  have  been  made  fully  aware  of  all  you  have  done  for  your  mother-in-law  since  the  death  of  your  husband,  how  you  left  your  father  and  mother  and  the  land  of  your  birth,  and  how  you  came  to  a  people  you  did  not  know  before.  
  <b> 12  </b></a></span>  May  the  LORD  repay  your  work,  and  may  you  receive  a  rich  reward  from  the  LORD,  the  God  of  Israel,  under  whose  wings  you  have  taken  refuge.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 13  </b></a></span>  &#8220;My  lord,&#8221;  she  said,  &#8220;may  I  continue  to  find  favor  in  your  eyes,  for  you  have  comforted  and  spoken  kindly  to  your  maidservant,  though  I  am  not  like  one  of  your  servant  girls.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 14  </b></a></span>  At  mealtime  Boaz  said  to  her,  &#8220;Come  over  here;  have  some  bread  and  dip  it  into  the  vinegar  sauce.&#8221;  So  she  sat  down  beside  the  harvesters,  and  he  offered  her  roasted  grain,  and  she  ate  and  was  satisfied  and  had  some  left  over.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 15  </b></a></span>  When  Ruth  got  up  to  glean,  Boaz  ordered  his  young  men,  &#8220;Even  if  she  gathers  among  the  sheaves,  do  not  insult  her.  
  <b> 16  </b></a></span>  Rather,  pull  out  for  her  some  stalks  from  the  bundles  and  leave  them  for  her  to  gather.  Do  not  rebuke  her.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 17  </b></a></span>  So  Ruth  gathered  grain  in  the  field  until  evening.  And  when  she  beat  out  what  she  had  gleaned,  it  was  about  an  ephah  of  barley.<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>a</a></span>    
  <b> 18  </b></a></span>  She  picked  up  the  grain  and  went  into  the  town,  where  her  mother-in-law  saw  what  she  had  gleaned.  And  she  brought  out  what  she  had  saved  from  her  meal  and  gave  it  to  Naomi.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 19  </b></a></span>  Then  her  mother-in-law  asked  her,  &#8220;Where  did  you  glean  today,  and  where  did  you  work?  Blessed  be  the  man  who  noticed  you.&#8221;  <p  class=|reg|>  So  she  told  her  mother-in-law  where  she  had  worked.  &#8220;The  name  of  the  man  I  worked  with  today  is  Boaz,&#8221;  she  said.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 20  </b></a></span>  Then  Naomi  said  to  her  daughter-in-law,  &#8220;May  he  be  blessed  by  the  LORD,  who  has  not  withdrawn  His  kindness  from  the  living  or  the  dead.&#8221;  Naomi  continued,  &#8220;The  man  is  a  close  relative.  He  is  one  of  our  kinsman-redeemers.<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>b</a></span>&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 21  </b></a></span>  Then  Ruth  the  Moabitess  said,  &#8220;He  also  told  me,  &#8216;Stay  with  my  young  men  until  they  have  finished  gathering  all  my  harvest.&#8217;&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 22  </b></a></span>  And  Naomi  said  to  her  daughter-in-law  Ruth,  &#8220;My  daughter,  it  is  good  for  you  to  work  with  his  young  women,  so  that  nothing  will  happen  to  you  in  another  field.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 23  </b></a></span>  So  Ruth  stayed  close  to  the  servant  girls  of  Boaz  to  glean  grain  until  the  barley  and  wheat  harvests  were  finished.  And  she  lived  with  her  mother-in-law.   <span  class=|fnverse|>17</span>  <span  class=|footnotesbot|>a</span>  <i>An  ephah</i>  is  approximately  20  dry  quarts  or  22  liters  (probably  about  29  pounds  or  13.2  kilograms  of  barley).<br><span  class=|fnverse|>20</span>  <span  class=|footnotesbot|>b</span>  The  Hebrew  word  for  <i>kinsman-redeemer</i>  or  <i>guardian-redeemer</i>  is  a  legal  term  for  the  kinsman  who  redeems  or  vindicates  a  relative;  see  Leviticus  25:25&#8211;55.<br> 
 Ruth  3   <p  class=|hdg|>Ruth&#8217;s  Redemption  Assured<p  class=|reg|>  <b> 1  </b></a></span>  One  day  Ruth&#8217;s  mother-in-law  Naomi  said  to  her,  &#8220;My  daughter,  should  I  not  seek  a  resting  place  for  you,  that  it  may  be  well  with  you?  
  <b> 2  </b></a></span>  Now  is  not  Boaz,  with  whose  servant  girls  you  have  been  working,  a  relative  of  ours?  In  fact,  tonight  he  is  winnowing  barley  on  the  threshing  floor.  
  <b> 3  </b></a></span>  Therefore  wash  yourself,  put  on  perfume,  and  wear  your  best  clothes.  Go  down  to  the  threshing  floor,  but  do  not  let  the  man  know  you  are  there  until  he  has  finished  eating  and  drinking.  
  <b> 4  </b></a></span>  When  he  lies  down,  note  the  place  where  he  lies.  Then  go  in  and  uncover  his  feet,  and  lie  down,  and  he  will  explain  to  you  what  you  should  do.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 5  </b></a></span>  &#8220;I  will  do  everything  you  say,&#8221;  Ruth  answered.  
  <b> 6  </b></a></span>  So  she  went  down  to  the  threshing  floor  and  did  everything  her  mother-in-law  had  instructed  her  to  do.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 7  </b></a></span>  After  Boaz  had  finished  eating  and  drinking  and  was  in  good  spirits,  he  went  to  lie  down  at  the  end  of  the  heap  of  grain.  Then  Ruth  went  in  secretly,  uncovered  his  feet,  and  lay  down.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 8  </b></a></span>  At  midnight,  Boaz  was  startled,  turned  over,  and  there  lying  at  his  feet  was  a  woman!  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 9  </b></a></span>  &#8220;Who  are  you?&#8221;  he  asked.  <p  class=|reg|>&#8220;I  am  your  servant  Ruth,&#8221;  she  replied.  &#8220;Spread  the  corner  of  your  garment<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>a</a></span>    over  me,  for  you  are  a  kinsman-redeemer.<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>b</a></span>&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 10  </b></a></span>  Then  Boaz  said,  &#8220;May  the  LORD  bless  you,  my  daughter.  You  have  shown  more  kindness  now  than  before,  because  you  have  not  run  after  the  younger  men,  whether  rich  or  poor.  
  <b> 11  </b></a></span>  And  now  do  not  be  afraid,  my  daughter.  I  will  do  for  you  whatever  you  request,  since  all  my  fellow  townspeople  know  that  you  are  a  woman  of  noble  character.  
  <b> 12  </b></a></span>  Yes,  it  is  true  that  I  am  a  kinsman-redeemer,  but  there  is  a  redeemer  nearer  than  I.<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>c</a></span>    
  <b> 13  </b></a></span>  Stay  here  tonight,  and  in  the  morning,  if  he  wants  to  redeem  you,  good.  Let  him  redeem  you.  But  if  he  does  not  want  to  redeem  you,  as  surely  as  the  LORD  lives,  I  will.  Now  lie  here  until  morning.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 14  </b></a></span>  So  she  lay  down  at  his  feet  until  morning,  but  she  got  up  before  anyone  else  could  recognize  her.  <p  class=|reg|>  Then  Boaz  said,  &#8220;Do  not  let  it  be  known  that  a  woman  came  to  the  threshing  floor.&#8221;  
  <b> 15  </b></a></span>  And  he  told  her,  &#8220;Bring  the  shawl  you  are  wearing  and  hold  it  out.&#8221;  When  she  did  so,  he  poured  in  six  measures  of  barley<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>d</a></span>    and  placed  it  on  her.  Then  he  went<span  class=|fn|><a  href=|#fn|>e</a></span>    into  the  city.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 16  </b></a></span>  When  Ruth  returned  to  her  mother-in-law,  Naomi  asked  her,  &#8220;How  did  it  go,  my  daughter?&#8221;  <p  class=|reg|>  Then  Ruth  told  her  all  that  Boaz  had  done  for  her.  
  <b> 17  </b></a></span>  And  she  said,  &#8220;He  gave  me  these  six  measures  of  barley,  for  he  said,  &#8216;Do  not  go  back  to  your  mother-in-law  empty-handed.&#8217;&#8221;

  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 7  </b></a></span>  Now  in  former  times  in  Israel,  concerning  the  redemption  or  exchange  of  property,  to  make  any  matter  legally  binding  a  man  would  remove  his  sandal  and  give  it  to  the  other  party,  and  this  was  a  confirmation  in  Israel.  
  <b> 8  </b></a></span>  So  the  kinsman-redeemer  removed  his  sandal  and  said  to  Boaz,  &#8220;Buy  it  for  yourself.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 9  </b></a></span>  At  this,  Boaz  said  to  the  elders  and  all  the  people,  &#8220;You  are  witnesses  today  that  I  am  buying  from  Naomi  all  that  belonged  to  Elimelech,  Chilion,  and  Mahlon.  
  <b> 10  </b></a></span>  Moreover,  I  have  acquired  Ruth  the  Moabitess,  Mahlon&#8217;s  widow,  as  my  wife,  to  raise  up  the  name  of  the  deceased  through  his  inheritance,  so  that  his  name  will  not  disappear  from  among  his  brothers  or  from  the  gate  of  his  home.  You  are  witnesses  today.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 11  </b></a></span>  &#8220;We  are  witnesses,&#8221;  said  the  elders  and  all  the  people  at  the  gate.  &#8220;May  the  LORD  make  the  woman  entering  your  home  like  Rachel  and  Leah,  who  together  built  up  the  house  of  Israel.  May  you  be  prosperous  in  Ephrathah  and  famous  in  Bethlehem.  
  <b> 12  </b></a></span>  And  may  your  house  become  like  the  house  of  Perez,  whom  Tamar  bore  to  Judah,  because  of  the  offspring  the  LORD  will  give  you  by  this  young  woman.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|hdg|>Boaz  Marries  Ruth<p  class=|reg|>  <b> 13  </b></a></span>  So  Boaz  took  Ruth,  and  she  became  his  wife.  And  when  he  had  relations  with  her,  the  LORD  enabled  her  to  conceive,  and  she  gave  birth  to  a  son.  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 14  </b></a></span>  Then  the  women  said  to  Naomi,  &#8220;Blessed  be  the  LORD,  who  has  not  left  you  this  day  without  a  kinsman-redeemer.  May  his  name  become  famous  in  Israel.  
  <b> 15  </b></a></span>  He  will  renew  your  life  and  sustain  you  in  your  old  age.  For  your  daughter-in-law,  who  loves  you  and  is  better  to  you  than  seven  sons,  has  given  him  birth.&#8221;  
  <p  class=|reg|>  <b> 16  </b></a></span>  And  Naomi  took  the  child,  placed  him  on  her  lap,  and  became  a  nurse  to  him.
